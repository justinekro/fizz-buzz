# Statement

Stage 1
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “

Stage 2

-   A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
-   A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

# Implementation

Project will be written in JavaScript using test-driven development

# Run

To run the program, just run "node fizz_buzz.js" on your terminal, in the "fizz-buzz" folder :)
